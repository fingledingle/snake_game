# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with walls and itself.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your system
- Turtle graphics library (usually included in Python standard library)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/snake-game.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: 
    ```sh
   cd snake-game
   
3. Run the game: 
    ```sh
   python main.py

### How to Play
- Use the W, S, A, and D keys to control the snake's movement.
  - W: Move the snake up
  - S: Move the snake down
  - A: Move the snake left
  - D: Move the snake right

- The snake will move continuously in the direction it's facing.

- Eat the food (green dot) to grow longer.

- Avoid running into walls or the snake's own body.

### Features
